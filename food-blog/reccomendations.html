review: this is my second time at the jeni’s splendid ice cream armitage (brown line cta) location. they have a couple of new flavors and awesome dairy-free options to try from. from my subpar memory, the only dairy free option i had the last time i came (september 2018) was the dark chocolate truffle. </p>
            <p>
i went with a half scoop of one of my favs, the dark chocolate truffle, and a half scoop of (dairy-free) texas sheet cake ($5.50 for two half scoops) ugh, they just taste amazing and i honestly found that the new flavors help reinvent jeni’s appeal. also, texas sheet cake is definitely a new fav. i’ve had an okay experience the last time i went to this location but had been wanting to come back to experience the wonderful ice cream they produce.
